# ShoppingCartSystem
This Java program simulates a shopping cart system where users can, add multiple products to a cart. apply different types of discounts (Festive, Bulk)  Pay the final amount using an OnlinePayment method. It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and interface implementation
